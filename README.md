## 🎯 About Me

I am a Systems Analysis and Development student at UniCEUB (expected graduation: July 2026). I work on developing systems, automating processes, handling data, and integrating services.

My past experiences include internships at the **Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MRE)** and, currently, at the **Ministry of Human Rights and Citizenship (MDHC)**, where I contributed to digital transformation and data-driven initiative. Both organisations were driven by Agile methodologies and multidisciplinary teams, including brazilian diplomats around the globe and other civil servants of all backgrounds, mostly specialists in public policy. In that regard, I am Scrum certified (PSM I).

Most of my work has been in the analysis and development of enterprise software, using Jakarta EE, Spring Boot, Hibernate and PostgreSQL, mostly microsservices development and management. Some of the legacy systems I worked on helped me build experience with MySQL, Core Java and monolithic architecture. During my time at MRE I worked with data analysis and cleaning, using R, Python and Power BI, to treat and expose foreign commerce of agricultural products.

I am passionate about **Machine Learning**, **LLMs (Large Language Models)**, and backend technologies like **Java + Spring Boot**. My goal is to bridge theory and practice, working in impact-oriented projects in AI and software.
